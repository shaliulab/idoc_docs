The IDOC (Individual *Drosophila* Olfactory Conditioner) setup is a behavioral training and monitoring system used in behavioral neuroscience research for studying learning and memory consolidation in *Drosophila* flies.  The IDOC system can be built by following the instructions provided in the IDOC documentation available at https://IDOC-docs.readthedocs.io. The documentation is aimed at researchers interested in using the IDOC system for their experiments, and it includes detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures, equipment and materials required for building the system, instructions for assembling the IDOC chambers, wiring and powering cables, troubleshooting tips, and suggestions for optimizing the experiments. The documentation also includes information on programing and codes used in the IDOC software, including, video tracking, software installation process, data processing techniques, visualization, and statistical analyses. 


Building the IDOC system requires basic electronics and 3D printing skills, as well as access to the required parts and tools. The documentation provides detailed instructions and resources for building each component of the IDOC system. The IDOC system involves installing the necessary software packages and dependencies, as well as configuring the system for use with specific experimental setups and hardware devices.

Here we provide a step-by-step instruction on how to build an IDOC setup. The steps are organized into several sections, each of which provides specific instructions and information related to different aspects of the IDOC system and its various components, but generally include the following:

**The electric shock circuit** section provides a detailed instructions for assembling the circuit to connect electric shock for each IDOC chamber. The section also includes a circuit diagram and notes on how to troubleshoot the circuit if it does not function as expected.

**The IR-optogenetic system** section provides a list of required materials and tools, as well as instructions for assembling the system. The section includes information on the different types of IR and high power LEDS and drivers that can be used and explains how to test the optogenetic system to ensure that it is functioning properly.

**The air odor delivery system** section provides instructions for building a system that can deliver different odorants to individual flies in the IDOC chamber. 

**The enclosure breadboard system** section provides instructions for building a system for mounting the components of the IDOC system, such as air/odor delivery system, the electric shock circuit and the IR optogenetic system. 

**The camera mounting** section provides instructions for building a system for mounting a camera above the IDOC chamber to monitor the behavior of individual flies during experiments to allow a real-time monitoring of behavioral responses. 

**The heat sink installation** section provides instructions for installing a heat sink to mount the IR-LED and high-power LEDs to prevent overheating during experiments. 

**The IDOC chamber assembly** section provides detailed instructions for assembling the IDOC chamber itself and provides notes on how to optimize the chamber for different experiments (e.g., olfaction, optogenetic, thermogenetic, etc.)  

**The wiring and powering cables** section provides information on how to wire the various components of the IDOC system together and how to connect the system to a power source. 

**The list of commercial parts and tools** section provides a list of recommended parts and tools that can be used to build the IDOC system.

**The protocols** section provides step-by-step procedures for behavior monitoring during the learning and memory experiments using the IDOC system. The section includes information on how to prepare the flies, how to perform the experiments, and how to analyze the results.

**Installation and usage** section provide steps to install the necessary software dependencies including Python packages to train several *Drosophila* individuals using odors, electro shocks and optogenetics.
