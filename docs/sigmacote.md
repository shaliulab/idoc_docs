## How to use Sigmacote on the glass surface



1.    **Cleaning:**

      The glass surface to be siliconized **must be** clean. Clean the pre-coated glasssurface first with ethanol, followed by overnight treatment with 10–20% (w/v)sodium hydroxide solutions (only use deionized water). Removal of the silicon coating can be monitored by rinsing the glass item and observing the"beading" or "sheeting" of water. 

2.    **Post clean wash**

      Remove the aqueous solution and wash the glass slides with running deionized water for several times.

3.    **Drying** Remove the deionized water and dry glass slides in oven at 80-100 degrees  for at least one hour. This will produce a very dry surface.

4.    **Sigmacote**

**a.** Pour the required volume of Sigmacote into a small glass bottle or cap.

**b.** Add enough sigmacote to cover the surface of your glass . Spread with the pipette tip or brush.  

**c.** Once the desired number of glass slides is made, return the remaining Sigmacote into the Sigmacote bottle, store at 4 °C.

**d.** Allow the treated glass surface to dry in a chemical hood (for ~1 h if time is limited).

**e.** After the heptane has evaporated, the siliconized slides can be oven dried at 80-100 oC for at least one hour. This will produce a slightly more durable coating.

**f.** Rinse the siliconized slides with deionized water to remove the HCl byproducts. Genteelly dry with a Kim wipe tissue. 

**g.** Leave slides to completely dry in a hood or oven for at least one hour before use. 

If you are going to use plastic sheets e.g. Acrylic glass, then coated with Fluon is best option. You just need to dilute it to 10% and rinse your sheets in it and then keep it to dry before using. 



note: The above protocol is applied to the top non-ITO glass slides in case you would like to use only the bottom glass slide as ITO-glass slides. During the training session, in case you want to keep the flies moving on the bottom ITO glass-slide. You might need to use Sigmacote to prevent the flies to jump into the top non ITO-glass slides.  However, we recommend using the top and bottom glass slides to be ITO-glass slides.
