**How to assemble chambers**





**1. Cleaning and Adjusting printed parts**:

1.1 - Make sure to remove any remaining material from **support** or **adhesion** of your 3D printed parts. Use warm water to dissolve PVA Material. 

1.2 - Use **[2 mm drill bit](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/FOCCTS-0-5-3-0-Rotating-Jewellery-Beeswax/dp/B07DXLFRQ8)** to remove material to adjust screw holes (8 x)

1.3 - Use **[0.8 mm drill bit](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/FOCCTS-0-5-3-0-Rotating-Jewellery-Beeswax/dp/B07DXLFRQ8)** to remove material to adjust needle holes (3x ---> right, left, middle)





**2. Screws and Needles Insertion**:

2.1 - Insert 8x long-screws **(2M -12 mm, RS , [482-9114](https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/machine-screws/4829114))**, check that everything is centered and vertical. then using flat screwdriver bit **(RS, [668-5723](https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/screwdriver-bit-sets/6685727); amazon, ([B01M7PPJI7](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Precision-Screwdriver-Magnetic-Macbook-Electronics/dp/B01M7PPJI7)))** to completely place the screws to the opposite direction.

2.2 - Center left and right green 0.8mm needles **(BD, [304423](https://www.farmaline.be/apotheek/bestellen/bd-microlance-3-naald-21g-1-12-rb-08x40-mm-groen-1/))**, with 6 mm rubber ring **(VWR, [228-0709](https://be.vwr.com/store/product/nl/577021/slangen-silicone))**, in either side of chamber. Introduce them gently inside enough to be seen from the other side.

note: the needle and 6-mm rubber ring are custom cut to a specific length.


**3. Bottom Glass insertion**:

3.1 - Fix **[a rubber gasket](https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/silicone-rubber-sheets/8405541/)**  to the bottom of the chamber.  The rubber must stand out and fit in its place.
note: the bottom rubber is custom cut to a specific size from translucent silicone rubber sheet **(RS Components, 840-5541)**

3.2 - Add one **ITO/glass slide** to the bottom of the chamber. Keep them horizontal on the bench. 

**4. Inner Chamber Insertion**:

4.1 - Center the middle rubber piece on the top of the glass. Make sure that it is placed correctly in its holder, then insert right and left needles into the rubber.   
note: the middle rubber that hold the inner chamber is custom made to a specific size, and both needle holes are drilled.
  

4.2 - Place the **window-like template** in the top of chamber to create  a room for the inner chamber by cutting out a rectangle inside the rubber. Use a **sharp blade** and the guides of the template. Make it as vertical as possible. Ideally, each side should be done in one stroke

4.3 - Carefully remove the cut part of the rubber. use sharp blade and forceps if needed, then remove the window template.

4.4 - Place one inner chamber in the center of the rubber  

4.5 - Prepare the inner chamber **0.8 mm** holes. Use 0.8 mm drill bit and a very sharp 0.8 mm needle to adjust the three holes. Check the quality of **fish-shape**.  

4.6 - Insert the green needles from step 2.2, until their tip comes out inside the triangular cavities in the inner chamber. Make sure the needles are not blocked or closed. Pressing air through with a syringe can help.

4.7 - Insert and center the **middle needle** to the inner chamber from direction of the inner chamber. Be sure that needle is **not blocked or closed**. Cut the outer part of the needle. 



**5. Connecting outflow tubing and fly gate rubber**:

5.1 - Attach small piece (~5 cm) of tubing **(Silicon Tubing ID 1.5mm x 3 mm OD (VWR, [228-1450](https://be.vwr.com/store/catalog/product.jsp?catalog_number=228-1450)) with WPI lure, [13160-100](https://www.wpiinc.com/13160-100-male-luer-fitting-for-1-16-id-tubing))** to the outer tip of middle needle.

5.2 - Place a 6 mm tubing in the side opening to create an O-ring Rubber in the place where the fly is loaded (gate to provide no leak). Cut it to be aligned with the outer side of the chamber. 



**6. Cleaning, top Glass insertion and Closing**:

6.1 - Add a second **glass-slide** on the top of the inner chamber; Keep them horizontal on the bench. The slide must stand out and fit into its place 

6.2 - Add the top rubber above the glass-slide 

6.3 - Add the **window** to the chamber, then attach 8x nuts **(RS, [248-4551](https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/hex-nuts/2484551/))** to the screws. Balance and twist them using 4 mm Hexagon Nut Driver **(RS, [323-2581](https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/nut-drivers/3232581))**. **Do not add much force** Only more squeezing, when they have leakage during testing the chamber.



**How to check chambers once assembled**

* Test the chamber by connecting it to the flowmeter. Max 500 ml per litre.  Inflow must equal outflow.
* Test right and left sides independently  
* Use a waterbath to identify the source of any leak. Submerge the chamber in it and pay attention to any bubbles exiting the chamber
