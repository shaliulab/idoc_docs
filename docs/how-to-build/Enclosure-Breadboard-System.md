# **Breadboard Enclosure System**



##  **Preface**



The IDOC setup is enclosed in a custom enclosure and mounted on breadboards baseplate.  The breadboard enclosure system protects the setup components from dust, acoustic vibrations, thermal gradients, and light.  It is supplied by a sliding door panel, which is mounted on the front side of the enclosure, to be removed for easy access to the setup components to load recording chambers. Its baseplate allows fixing and center the IDOC system via mounting brackets. It can be mounted on the table or bench.  You may construct the enclosure according to the size desired. However, it should be large enough to hold all your setup components. This section details how to construct an enclosure to provide space for the setup, tracking camera, powering, airflow system, and illumination.



Building the IDOC enclosure  involves several steps:

1. Design and build the custom enclosure and 3D parts to fit the IDOC system.
2. Install a breadboard to mount the enclosure, which provides a platform for mounting and connecting electronic components.
3. Install and wire any necessary electronic, lighting, air/odor components



**Detailed diagram of enclosure components:**

The enclosure has three main sections: The baseplate, setup enclosure and the camera enclosure.

## **III-**      **Setup Enclosure**



The setup enclosure is made from [25 mm rails](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=194) and [black hardboard](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=190#2535) panels. The panels are placed by the rail channels. The enclosure is designed with following inner dimensions (L x W x H) 500mm x 500mm x 700 mm.

**Installation steps**

**A-**  **Customize the black hardboard**

**B-**  **Join the rails & build the walls**

**C-**  **Build the enclosure roof**

**D-**  **Enclosure door**

**E-**  **Holes and powering platform on back side.**



### **A-**  **Customize the** black hardboard

For this step, you will need:

\-     Black hardboard ([TB4](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB4), Thorlabs)

\-     Black hardboard ([TB5](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB5), Thorlabs)

\-     Adhesive double-sided tape ([273-598](https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/double-sided-tapes/0273598), RS Components)

\-     Aluminum flat bar ([681-104](https://ie.rs-online.com/web/p/metal-bars-metal-rods/0681104), RS Components)

\-     Pencil

\-     Cutter

\-     Tape measure or ruler



Be sure that the correct size of the black board has been ordered or in house customized to fit the dimensions of the enclosure that the setup will be installed on. We combined two black hardboards together ([TB4](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB4) + [TB5](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB5)) to provide more hardness, thickness and to eliminate the passage of light through the corners or edges. The foam core of the board provides enhanced acoustic absorption and preserve the enclosure temperature.



The final size of the panels:

·    Vertical panels that form the walls of the enclosure: 710-mm x 510-mm (L x W)

·    The top panel that forms the roof of the enclosure: 510-mm to 450-mm (L x W)





![Black-board-setup-enclosure.PNG](/assets/Images/Black-board-setup-enclosure.PNG)




 **Procedures**

1.1.    Using a tape measure mark a line by pencil on the face of black board to the correct size. Be sure that the final size is about 5 mm longer and 5 mm wider than the rail length to fit in the walls and the roof.

1.2.    Cut all the way through the board following the pencil lines. The blackboard is soft, so proceed carefully, aluminum flat bar can be used to keep straight cut. Be careful not to injury your fingers.

1.3.    Remove the cuts and trim the rough edges of the black hardboard.

1.4.    Attach and align the adhesive double-sided tape within the inside face/ edge of the TB5 black board.

1.5.    Simply peel off the tape backing and assemble one TB4 board and one TB5 board together, the adhesive double-sided tape should not show on the board when done

1.6.    Make sure to press firmly on the assembled boards to prevent it from peeling it off from the tape.

1.7.    The thickness of the finished double black board is about 5 mm, where it will be placed and aligned in the rail channels of the enclosure frame.





### **B-**   **Join the rails & build the walls:**

For this step, you will need:

\-     Low-Profile Channel Screw (Q: 12x)

\-     Construction Cube with Slotted Corners (Q: 4x)

\-     25-mm square construction rail 500-mm length (Q: 4x)

![Setup-enclosure.PNG](/assets/Images/Setup-enclosure.PNG)






**Procedures**

1.8.      Attach low-profile channel screw to the construction cube. Low-profile screw has a shortened cap height that prevents neighboring screws from interfering with each other which can be used as a three-way 25 mm rail junction.

1.9.      Insert the screw into the threaded hole in the end of each rail and tighten both screws down with the balldriver to connect the two rails.

1.10.    Repeat the above step for the other corners to finish the horizontal bottom square frame.

1.11.    Place another channel screw into the third hole of construction cube, then insert it into the threaded hole in the end of the vertical rail and tighten screws down with the balldriver to create three-way connection

1.12.    Repeat above step for connecting the other vertical rails.

1.13.    Slide the double black hardboard into the channel of the frame rails to form the back, left and right side. Keep the foam core outside of the enclosure while the darkest board inside the box.



1.14.

### **C-**  **Build the enclosure roof**



![Top-roof.PNG](/assets/Images/Top-roof.PNG)


For this step, you will need:

\-     Low-Profile Channel Screws (Q:10x)

**Procedures**

1.15.    Attach low-profile channel screw to the construction cube.

1.16.    Insert the screw into the threaded hole in the end of each rail and tighten both screws down with the balldriver to connect the two rails.

1.17.    Repeat the above step for the other corner to have a U-shaped frame formed by three rails.

1.18.    Slide the blackboard into the channels of the U-shaped frame rails.

1.19.    To mount other parts on the top roof, insert about six-low-profile nuts in each unobstructed end of the rails of the U-shaped frame. Be sure that you inserted the T-Nut before going to the next step, since nuts only can be inserted and removed from unblocked end of a rail.

1.20.    Attach the 3D- printed door construction cube at each end of the U-shaped frame, by the way the sliding hole of the door are vertically in front of the other.

1.21.    Insert the screw into the threaded hole in the end of U-shaped frame and tighten both screws down with the balldriver.

1.22.    Use 3D printed elbow L-Connection to connect the fourth rail from each corner by inserting low-Profile T-Nut.

1.23.    Attach low-profile channel screw to the elbow L-Connection.

1.24.    Insert screws into corner low-profile T-nuts in the end of each rail and tighten them down with the balldriver to connect the two rails. Be sure that the elbow L-Connection is not blocking the sliding panel of the door at the 3D-construction cube at each side.





#### *1-   Camera visualization window in the enclosure roof:*

A window (112-mmx112mm) is made in the center of the roof to allow the visualization of the fly to be tracked by the outside camera. This window hosts a 3D-printed box which hold a [polyester infra-red (IR) sheet](https://www.leefilters.com/index.php/camera-directory/camera-dir-list/category/infrared) (100-mm x 100-mm) to prevent unwanted visible light to transmit inside the enclosure. Only IR light can be visualized by the camera. Also, the inside face of 3D-printed box can hold a light source (e.g. white LED stripe) that might be needed to illuminate the setup while cleaning or maintenance.

1.25.    Fasten the four pieces of LED stripes (15-cm each) in place with their adhesive side tape.

1.26.    Solder and connect all LED stripes pieces in the square box, the powering wire should be enough to be inserted outside of the enclosure.  Select the wire with red (+ve) and black (-ve) colors.

1.27.    Insert the IR filter in the recessed area, then fix it with a drop of fast glue at each corner.

1.28.    This step can be delayed until the complete assembly of the enclosure to avoid scratching of the black IR sheet.

1.29.    In case you deiced to attach the IR filter, Cover its surface with masking tape or paper, so you don't scratch it while building the other parts of the enclosure .

##### **Assembly and install the LED-IR box**



Because of the importance of the visualization window position. We designed a template to mark and facilitate the window cut as follow:



1.30.    Insert the template at the center of the black board

1.31.    Add a M6 screw in the middle of the template, push the screw through the soft blackboard until it is appeared from the other face.

1.32.    Use sharp cutter to cut all the way through the black board following the boarder of the template. The blackboard is soft, so proceed carefully.

1.33.    Remove the template with the cut and trim the edge of window made by the cutter.

1.34.    Insert 3D printed box with LED strip from the inside part.

1.35.    Make a hole in the blackboard to insert the powering cables outside of the enclosure to be connected to the power supply.

1.36.    Insert the other 3D printed IR sheet holder from the top side.

1.37.    Connect both parts by inserting a screw in each corner of the box.



1.38.

#### *2-   Blue light LED stripe:*



During experiments, we provided a minimum light for the flies to be sure not activating the opsin channels. From our in vivo patch clamp electrophysiology data we figured out that, the blue light only induce a bit activation at very high light intensity, while it is safe at low light intensity. Therefore, we illuminate the setup enclosure with a very dim blue light (less than 1µW/mm2)





![Blue-light-installation.PNG](/assets/Images/Blue-light-installation.PNG)






**Wiring the blue lighting stripe.**

 For this step, you will need:

\-     100-cm Blue LED Strips ([F3528Blue60-NW](https://ledlightsworld.com/products/colorful-dc-12v-dimmable-smd3528-600-flexible-led-strips-120-leds-per-meter-8mm-width-600lm-per-meter?variant=17870690320474), ledlightsworld) (Q:2x cut 50-cm each)

**Procedures**

1.39.    Clamp the end of the LED stripe using a soldering arm stand.

1.40.    Since LED light coppers pads have only two terminals, we choose to connect with a 2-bin JST cable with female plug which has two wires one with red color, while the other is black color.

1.41.    Heat your soldering iron station to 350-400 degrees Celsius.

1.42.    Add a small part of soldering material to the surface the copper pads of the LED strips

1.43.    Solder the 2bin JST wires to copper pads in the LED strip. The red wires must be solder to the positive copper cups and the black to the negative ones.

1.44.    Once you have attached the two wires, wait for at least 30 seconds for it to cool down.

1.45.    Use hot air gun to place a shrink tube over the exposed soldered part at the end of each LED stripes.

1.46.    With scissor cut two of 50-cm LED strips.





**Final Installation of the LED strip on the setup enclosure**

1.47.    Once everything in the enclosure is set, you can peel off the tape backing expose the adhesive side

1.48.    Place the blue LED strip of tape at the black aluminum rail at the top of the enclosure.

1.49.    Make sure to press firmly on the LED stripes to prevent it from peeling it off.

1.50.    Connect the female JST wire to the male JST power supply plug on the top powering platform at the backside of the enclosure. While the opposite side of the plug can then be connected to a power supply and dimmer switch.





#### *3-   Roof exhaust vent:*

Proper ventilation inside the enclosure will preserve its ambient temperature. We added two roof vents at the top of the enclosure to ensure a quick and complete vacuuming of odorants (in case of leakage) inside the enclosure and maintain the enclosure temperature. V*acuum* pump is used to remove the exhaust air outside of the room. Because smell can severely affect the quality of the fly olfactory conditioning experiments.

Exhaust vents placed on the top roof of the enclosure. While air intake is steady streamed by small fans in the bottom of the enclosure and from air inflow below the heatsink of the setup to cool the system and provide equal amounts of air exhaust with air intake inside the enclosure.

  **Procedures**

1.51.    Connect the fitting Straight adaptor to the middle hole of the vent cap, tighten the adaptor using 13-mm spanner.

1.52.    Make two holes in the roof of the enclosure so the two exhaust caps can be inserted. A pencil or other sharp tool can be used to mark the holes. A cutter or a 44-mm hole saw drill can be useful to get smooth hole.

1.53.    Insert the threaded neck part from the inside, attach the screw cap part from outside, and then tighten the cap until the assembly is held firmly to the roof to provide proper exhaust vents.



### **D-**  **Enclosure door**

The following parts are needed:

\-     [Black hardboard](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=190#2535)  510mmx762mm (L x W) ([TB5](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB5), Thorlabs) (Q: 2x)

For closing the front side of the enclosure during an experiment, we combined one of [TB5](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB5) black hardboards together with a black aluminum [sandwich panel](https://www.plexikopen.be/aluminium-sandwichpaneel-kleur) to provide more hardness, thickness and to eliminate the passage of light or air through the corners or edges. Be sure that the correct size of the black board has been ordered to fit the dimensions of the door area. There is no need to cut the board.

Since the construction cube provided by Thorlabs ([RM1S - 1](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=RM1S#ad-image-0) ) is only having slotted corners, we modified the later and 3D printed ([3D design)]( /src/3D_printed_parts/Construction_cube_with_slotted_channel_door_connection_universal.stl) This cube is connected at each top of the front rails and create a parallel channel with front rails (see step: Build the enclosure roof). The modified cube allowed us to make an open slider through each corner for inserting the door.

1.54.    Use Adhesive double-sided tape to combine one of [TB5](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TB5) black hardboard together with a black aluminum [sandwich panel](https://www.plexikopen.be/aluminium-sandwichpaneel-kleur).

1.55.    To close the enclosure, slide the door board from the top into the top parallel channels of the cube-rail-constructions.

1.56.    To remove the door, push the bottom of the board up until it completely getting out from the parallel guide of the front rails

## **IV-**     [**Baseplate**](https://reiserlab.github.io/Component-Designs/miscellaneous/baseplate)



Solid black aluminum breadboard with threaded mounting holes provides a convenient platform for mounting the setup enclosure and other components. The breadboard should be bigger than the setup base, i.e., larger in both length and width. To isolate the setup from the light and airflow coming from the threaded mounting holes of the baseplate, attach a [black hardboard](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=190#2535) panel to the bottom breadboard which mounted by four Sorbothane feet (AV5/M). These Sorbothane mounting feet also offer excellent isolation of vibration and possible acoustic noise. The parts needed are provided in the figure below.

**How to build the baseplate?**

Construct the baseplate in the following manner:

1.72.    Insert a [black hardboard](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=190#2535) panel below the aluminum breadboard at the bottom side,

1.73.    Inset four (M6) cap screws in the counterbored holes at each corner of the breadboard,

1.74.    press the (M6) screw to create holes into the [black hardboard](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=190#2535). If necessary, hand drill may be useful at this step.

1.75.    Attach the threaded hole of [vibration isolation feet](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=6421) to each screw at the corner of the breadboard.

1.76.    Tighten each screw down with the [balldriver or hex key](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1407).

1.77.    Trim the extra edges of the [black hardboard](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=190#2535) to be exactly aligned to the breadboard. When cutting, be careful not to injury your fingers.

1.78.    Place the baseplate horizontally on the rubber feet to be ready when connecting the assembled enclosure.





## **V-**       **Breadboard Enclosure Mounting**

The enclosure is attached directly to the baseplate using the XE25CL2 Clamp to mount a 25 mm rail horizontally to a M6 tapped surface by using a side-located rail channel.

1.79.    Put the assembled enclosure on the top of the assembled baseplate,

1.80.    Align and center the enclosure to the breadboard by mount bottom rails horizontally on breadboard,

1.81.    Slot the clamp into the rail channel to secure it parallel to the breadboard surface,

1.82.    Inset M6 screw in the clamp long clearance

1.83.    Move the clamps to the corners of the enclosure and tighten down with the [balldriver or hex key](https://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1407).

1.84.    Right now, both breadboard and enclosure are tightly connected.
