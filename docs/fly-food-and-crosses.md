# Fly Maintenance, Crosses, and Collection

## Preparing the Experimental Flies

- Maintain parent fly stocks at 21°C - 25°C with controlled humidity under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle in standard fly food vials.
- Select virgin females of UAS and males of Gal4 in standard fly food vials.
- Allow parent flies to mate and lay eggs for 3–5 days. Afterwards, remove the parent flies and wait for the progeny.
- Collect flies (~15 females + 5 males) on a CO2 fly pad under a stereomicroscope with a blue light filter Lighting Insert Filter (Blue) (Fisher, [11830963](https://www.fishersci.be/shop/products/insert-filter-10/11830963)).
- Ensure flies are of normal size with fully expanded wings. Exclude any sick flies.
- House the flies in a standard food vial with ATR (400µM).
- Keep the collected flies in Tritech incubators at 21±°C, with a 12:12 h blue light/dark cycle and humidity over 90%, for one to two days, allowing them to mate. Only test mated female flies.
- Transfer only mated female flies to a new standard food vial with ATR. (See the next step for preparing an ATR-food-vial.)
- Move flies to a new standard food vial with ATR at least 24 hours before the experiment.
- Use adult flies that are age-matched and in the range of 4-5 days post-eclosion for IDOC and sleep assays.

## Preparing ATR Normal Food Vial & Tubes

- Place 200 ml of fresh food in a microwave oven and heat for about 45 seconds or until it begins to melt.
- Stir the food with a pipette to remove clumps, and heat for a few more seconds until melted.
- Wait until the food temperature is around 50ºC, and use a thermometer [(e.g., 620-0787)](https://nl.vwr.com/store/product/573889/milieuvriendelijke-thermometers-easy-read) to monitor it.
- Add the ATR stock (4µl/1 ml food). For a 200 ml preparation, you will need 800µl of a 100mM ATR stock solution. **Note:** The ATR stock is prepared in ethanol with a 100mM concentration. Split it into small aliquots in tubes: either 200µl for a 50 ml food preparation or 800µl for a 200 ml food preparation.
- Stir and mix the ATR food well until it appears more yellowish.
- Transfer the food into small vials, about 5ml for each tube.
- Let the tubes cool at room temperature for a few minutes before moving them to a 4ºC storage room. Protect the tubes from light using aluminum foil.
- A small portion of the above-prepared food can be kept aside to prepare Normal-ATR-food-agar-tubes for some experiments, e.g., Appetitive memory.

## Preparing ATR Sucrose Agar Tubes

- Place 50ml of fresh or refrigerated 5% sucrose/2% fly agar in a microwave oven and heat for about 60 seconds or until completely melted. Make sure to heat up the wax before starting.
- Wait until the food temperature reaches around 50ºC. Use a thermometer [(e.g., 620-0787)](https://nl.vwr.com/store/product/573889/milieuvriendelijke-thermometers-easy-read) to monitor it.
- Add the ATR stock (4µl/1 ml food). If you've prepared 50 ml, you will need 200µl of ATR stock solution.
- Stir and mix the ATR-sucrose-Agar until it appears more yellowish.
- Pour the mixed solution into a petri dish. A 50 ml solution is good for approximately 150 tubes. Group tubes together using a rubber band in the dish. Ensure the media is about 1 cm high and that the tubes are vertical. Protect the tubes and container from light using aluminum foil. Let them sit on the bench or move them to a 4ºC storage for at least 30 minutes.
- Carefully separate tubes from the sucrose/agar. Clean each tube to remove any remaining Agar media, then follow the lab's standard protocol to seal the agar end with paraffin wax.
